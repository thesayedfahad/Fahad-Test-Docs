Figma
: The design prototyping platform for which this documentation is written. 
  See [Introduction]({% link index.md %}) for more information.

Frame
: A Frame is a representation of the screen you wish to design your application for. 
  UI elements can only be placed inside frames, and often for every "screen" in your user interface you'll use a different Frame.

Account
: An account is what you use to authenticate with Figma, 
  to ensure that the projects that you create remain yours and not someone else's.
  
Project
: A project is a canvas upon which you put Frames, and likely represents your entire app.
