Figma
: The design prototyping platform for which this documentation is written. 
  See [Introduction]({% link /index.md %}) for more information.

Frame
: A Frame is a representation of the screen you wish to design your application for. 
  UI elements can only be placed inside frames, and often for every "screen" in your user interface you'll use a different Frame.
  For help with Frames, refer to [Create a Frame]({% link creating-frames.md %}).

Account
: An account is what you use to authenticate with Figma, 
  to ensure that the projects that you create remain yours and not someone else's.
  For help with creating an account, refer to [Create An Account]({% link new-account.md %}).
  
Project
: A project is a root folder in which you place your Files. The project represents your entire app.

File
: A file is a canvas upon which you put your frames, and is often used to represent a single task flow.
